	Execution Contect is actually different types of objects.There are two types of execution context.Global execution
	context and Function execution context.

	Global Execution context starts when we initially run a js file.There are several objects in global execution
	context.those are window,this(which actually points window,
	variable objects,scope chain).Initially a js file goes through with a loading or creation phase.

	Function Execution Context also have window,this(which actually points window,variable objects,scope chain).It
	passes arguments to the function
